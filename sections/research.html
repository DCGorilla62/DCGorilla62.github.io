  My research centers on the measurement of high-energy cosmic-ray nuclei using advanced detector technologies. I work on <a href="http://helix.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
HELIX (High-Energy Light Isotope eXperiment) </a>, a long-duration balloon mission designed to make high-precision measurements of rare cosmic-ray isotopes. These measurements provide insight into Galactic propagation, the history of stellar processes, and the structure of our local cosmic environment.
</p>
<p>
My contributions focus on detector calibration, reconstruction algorithms, and data analysis for the HELIX Drift Chamber Tracker. I develop software to model charge-division signals, perform track reconstruction, analyze isochrone timing, and evaluate systematic effects across the detector. I also work extensively with simulation tools and event-level data processing to prepare for upcoming Antarctic campaigns.
</p>
<p>
  More broadly, I am interested in the intersection of particle astrophysics, precision measurement, and instrumentation. I enjoy building tools that make complex detectors function reliably in extreme environments — and translating those measurements into physical insight about our Galaxy.
