<p>
  Service and community building are central to my identity as a scientist. I have devoted much of my academic career to strengthening support networks for students from historically excluded backgrounds in physics.
</p>

<p>
At Ohio State, I have taken on leadership roles in the Polaris program, served on departmental committees focused on diversity and graduate education, and helped grow the APS Bridge student community. These collective efforts have contributed to OSU becoming one of the strongest Bridge Program nodes in the country.
</p>

<p>
My engagement extends nationally through the APS Bridge Program, APS National Mentoring Community, SACNAS, the National Society of Hispanic Physicists, and regular participation in the NSBP–NSHP joint conference. Through these organizations I have built cross-institutional collaborations, presented invited talks, and worked to expand mentoring and leadership opportunities for students across the country.
