<p>
I am a PhD candidate in experimental astrophysics at The Ohio State University, where my work focuses on high-energy cosmic rays and the development of precision instrumentation for balloon-borne experiments. I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area in an immigrant Latino family, and my academic path began at Chabot Community College before transferring to California State University, East Bay.
</p>
<p>
My journey has always been shaped by community. I have been fortunate to learn from mentors, programs, and peers who opened doors for me, including the APS Bridge Program, Cal-Bridge, and the APS National Mentoring Community. These experiences taught me that no one succeeds alone — and that the most meaningful part of science is the people we bring with us.
</p>
<p>
At Ohio State, I have continued that work through leadership roles in the Polaris program, mentorship of undergraduates, and efforts to foster a more inclusive culture within the department. I am committed to helping students from historically excluded backgrounds feel supported, empowered, and connected within physics.
</p>
<p>
Every step of my academic career has reinforced the same lesson: science moves forward when we support one another. That principle guides both my research and my approach to mentorship.
