<!--     This is a placeholder about-me section designed to stand in until real content is added. It gives a sense of how the text will wrap, fill the layout, and balance against images or other elements on the page. This paragraph repeats ideas intentionally, providing enough volume to test spacing, alignment, and readability. You can use this to experiment with formatting, font sizes, margins, or any visual adjustments you want to make. The goal is simply to occupy space while keeping the tone neutral and unobtrusive. As you refine your design, you can replace sections of this text with actual biographical information, professional background, interests, or anything else you want featured. Until then, this placeholder continues to extend naturally, allowing you to preview the final proportions of your About page as you adjust styles across desktop, tablet, and mobile. -->

<p>
  My teaching philosophy centers on the idea that students thrive when they feel a sense of belonging, purpose, and community. Throughout my graduate career at Ohio State, I have taught and mentored extensively through the Polaris program, an undergraduate initiative focused on supporting students from underrepresented groups in physics and astronomy.
</p>
<p>
For three years, I served as the instructor for the Polaris Mentorship Course, where I designed curriculum, led discussions on scientific identity and professional development, and built a classroom environment centered on collaboration and mutual support. I have also mentored students through the URSA early-arrival program, helping new undergraduates transition into the physics community.
</p>
<p>
Across all of these roles, my goal has been the same: to create learning spaces where students feel seen, supported, and capable. My own nontraditional path into physics taught me how important structured mentorship can be, and I carry that experience into every teaching context — whether in the classroom, in research meetings, or through community-based programs.
