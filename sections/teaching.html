  My teaching philosophy centers on the idea that students thrive when they feel a sense of belonging, purpose, and community. Throughout my graduate career at Ohio State, I have taught and mentored extensively through the Polaris program, an undergraduate initiative focused on supporting students from underrepresented groups in physics and astronomy.
</p>
<p>
For three years, I served as the instructor for the Polaris Mentorship Course, where I designed curriculum, led discussions on scientific identity and professional development, and built a classroom environment centered on collaboration and mutual support. I have also mentored students through the URSA early-arrival program, helping new undergraduates transition into the physics community.
</p>
<p>
Across all of these roles, my goal has been the same: to create learning spaces where students feel seen, supported, and capable. My own nontraditional path into physics taught me how important structured mentorship can be, and I carry that experience into every teaching context — whether in the classroom, in research meetings, or through community-based programs.
